// Herdr: how many herdr servers are running, and a way into each of them.
//
// Herdr keeps one server per named session. They are easy to start and never
// stop by themselves - closing a window detaches, it does not end the session
// - so they pile up unseen. The bar shows the count; the panel names them,
// says which project and how many agents each one holds, and opens or kills
// one on a click.
//
// A session shows at most one window, because two windows on one session
// mirror each other. So "open" means: focus the window already showing this
// session, wherever it is, and only start a new one when there is none.
// `bin/herdr-sessions` does that matching by reading the herdr client's own
// command line off the processes behind each Hyprland window.
//
// The agent lines under a session are click targets of their own, one step
// further in: the pane is focused inside the server before the window is
// brought up, so a click lands on the piece of work you were reading rather
// than on wherever that session happened to be left.
//
// Project names are directory names and session names are whatever was passed
// to `herdr --session`, so every Text carries `textFormat: Text.PlainText`.
// Left on the default AutoText, Qt decides for itself that a string looks
// like markup and renders it as rich text - and rich text really does load
// `<img src="http://...">`, a request out of the shell process to a server
// someone else picked.
//
// The panel can also be pinned, which takes the same card out of the bar and
// leaves it on screen as a window you drag where you want it. A dropdown is
// something you open to answer a question and close again; a herd you are
// running is something you glance at all afternoon, and a panel that shuts
// the moment you touch anything else cannot be glanced at.
//
// Glyphs are \u escapes rather than literal characters, so the source
// survives editors and patches that mangle private-use codepoints.
